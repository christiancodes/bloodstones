![A set of Bloodstones](images/classic-bloodstones.jpg "A set of Bloodstones. Acrylic on hematite.")

## WHAT ARE BLOODSTONES?

A universal, open source board game mod. Bloodstones can augment virtually any board game.

A set of "classic" Bloodstones is comprised of **5 similar pieces of [hematite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite), each marked with the symbol of a blood droplet.** Game augmentations are called "Transfusions", and owners of Bloodstones are known as "Bloodkeepers".

## RULES

The rules of Bloodstones are flexible and can be determined by players. However, one mechanic must be present: **the sacrifice of a drop of blood per Bloodstone.**

A player, for example, might have to sacrifice blood if:

 - they lose a Bloodstone they started with,

 - they end the game with a Bloodstone they did not originally have,

 - they lose a wager of Bloodstones

These general rule-sets can be specialized for individual games as desired.

## POSSIBLE TRANSFUSIONS

 - **Chess:** A Bloodstone is placed in each Rook's castle-top basket. If one of your Rooks is captured, you must take its Bloodstone.

 - **Settlers of Catan:** If a player rolls a 7 with more than the allowable limit of cards in their hand, they receive a Bloodstone along with the usual penalties.

 - **Ticket To Ride:** At setup, Bloodstones are placed on chosen 6x-length routes. In order to complete one of those routes, the player must pay the price in blood as well as trains.

## THE SOCIAL ANGLE

Bloodstones are to remind you of those living with [Diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus), who must sacrifice drops of their blood daily in order to measure blood sugar levels. **Please donate to a reputable charitable organization in your area each time you run a Bloodstones Transfusion.**
